// In this example, I want to create an interactive form that allows Newt Scamander create a sort of inventory of the Fantastic Beasts he's rescuing
// Here's what we'll need to do:
// 1. Grab the input a user enters into our form
// 2. Represent this input in a meaningful way, let's say an Object
// 3. Push the contents of that Object into an Array 
// 4. Reset our form so that the user can add a new creature if they want without having to manually delete the previous input
// 5. Display the new creature in our Array back to the user on our page
